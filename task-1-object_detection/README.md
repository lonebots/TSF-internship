## Object Detection 
This is a simple object detection model done as a part of the TSF-internship Task-1 <br>
The model uses YOLO and openCV for making object detection and at present it is trained only to detect a class of pinapple with a decent amount of accuracy. The same model can be extended to make multi class prediction with very litte tweaks in the training classes.
